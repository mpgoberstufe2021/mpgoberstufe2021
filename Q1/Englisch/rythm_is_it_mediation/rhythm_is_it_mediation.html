Here in Germany, more precisely in Berlin, we had a really interesting dance project a year ago. It involved mainly hundreds of teenage kids form Berlin as well as dance instructors. A lot of the kids had a rough background. Most of them grew up in problematic Neighborhoods in Berlin and others immigrated from Russia and could barely speak German. </p><h3></h3><p>The goal was to perform Stravinsky’s ballet “Der Feuervogel”, the fire bird in the Berlin Philharmonic. The Beginning was bad. None of the kids really wanted to participate and they were just playing on their Game Boys. Furthermore, the kids didn’t take the Instructors seriously. As time progressed the Kids began to improve. This only happened due to the teachers being strict.</p><h3></h3><p> In the End 214 teenagers from a lot of rough backgrounds as well as an elderly dance Group performed in the Berlin Philharmonic with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under the British conductor Simon Rattle.  It was a huge success none of the teachers or students could believe it. </p></div><div class="footer"> <h3>Quellen:</h3> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fZA7sO6yUTfQaevPu3v_rO3XJ7sc6Drl">Worksheet</a></p></div><script type='text/javascript' src="script.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../../../MathJax-master/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full"></script></body></html>
